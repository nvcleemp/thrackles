Thrackles
=========

This repository groups several programs and code snippets to work with thrackles.

A thrackle is an embedded graph such that the following conditions are met:

* no edge intersects itself;
* adjacent edges do not intersect (except for the common vertex);
* non-adjacent edges intersect exactly once.

For more information about thrackles we refer to http://www.thrackle.org.
